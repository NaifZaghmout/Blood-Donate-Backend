## Bugs 


## Bug 1

### Symptom
In the `UserLogin` view's `post` method, there is an attempt to access the `user_id` attribute directly on the user object, leading to a simulated `AttributeError`.

### Error Message
Simulated error: `AttributeError: 'AppUser' object has no attribute 'user_id'`.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Send a login request to the UserLogin endpoint.
2. Simulate a scenario where the `user_id` attribute is not directly available on the user object.

### Resolution Steps
The error can be resolved by using the appropriate way to get the user ID. The suggested fix is to use the `id` attribute instead of `user_id`.

### Error Code
`class UserLogin(APIView):

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = UserLoginSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True):
            user = serializer.validated_data
            login(request, user)
            
            response_data = serializer.data.copy()
            response_data.pop('password')
            response_data['user_id'] = user.user_id
            
            return Response({'data': response_data}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)`


### Fix code

`class UserLogin(APIView):

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = UserLoginSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True):
            user = serializer.validated_data
            login(request, user)
            
            # Suggested fix: Use the 'id' attribute to get the user ID
            response_data = serializer.data.copy()
            response_data.pop('password')
            response_data['user_id'] = user.id  # Suggested fix
            
            return Response({'data': response_data}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)`




## Bug 2

**Symptom:**
In the `UserLoginSerializer` class, the `UserLogin` view expects a `user_id` attribute in the serializer's data, but the model `AppUser` does not have a `user_id` attribute, leading to a simulated `KeyError`.

**Error Message:**
1. Simulated error: `KeyError: 'user_id'`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Send a login request to the UserLogin endpoint.
2. Simulate a scenario where the `user_id` attribute is not present in the serializer's data.

**Resolution Steps:**
The error can be resolved by removing the unnecessary inclusion of the `user_id` attribute in the `UserLogin` view's post method.

**Error Code:**
`class UserLoginSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserModel
        fields = ['user_id', 'email', 'password', 'username']`



### Fix Code:

`class UserLoginSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserModel
        fields = ['email', 'password', 'username']`






## Issue 

### Issue: Frequent Rebase in Gitpod

#### Problem
Encountering recurring rebase conflicts in Gitpod due to concurrent development efforts. The situation is exacerbated by the late adoption of Agile methodology after the project initiation, leading to increased frequency of code changes.

#### Impact
- Disrupts development workflow.
- Increases the risk of overlooking critical changes.
- Requires constant manual conflict resolution during rebase.

#### Resolution

1. **Communication:**
   - Establish clear communication channels for code changes coordination.
   - Encourage team members to communicate development plans to minimize overlap.

2. **Branching Strategy:**
   - Adopt a feature branching strategy to isolate and manage specific features.

3. **Pulling Strategy:**
   - Encourage regular pulling of changes from the main branch to local branches.
   - Use `git pull --rebase` for a cleaner integration.

#### Agile Methodology Integration (Late Adoption)

**Problem:**
- Agile methodology was introduced late in the project after the mentor section, causing a delay in its benefits.

**Resolution:**
- Strike a balance between Agile's iterative development and effective communication.
- Ensure team members are aligned with Agile practices to minimize disruptions.
- Consider conducting a retrospective to identify areas for improvement and streamline Agile integration.

## Python validation


### Python Validation - PEP8 Linter

This section focuses on the linting process using the PEP8 online linter (https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The comment "// its all pass //" proudly indicates that the Python code has successfully passed all PEP8 linting checks.

#### PEP8 Linter Details:

- **Linter Used:** [PEP8 Online Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

- **Configuration:** The code adheres to the rules and configurations specified by PEP8, promoting consistent coding styles and identifying potential issues.

- **Clean Code Practices:** PEP8 linting ensures adherence to clean code practices, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

- **No Linter Warnings or Errors:** The absence of PEP8 warnings or errors signifies that the Python codebase meets the specified quality standards.

#### Why PEP8 Linting Matters:

PEP8 linting plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality by catching potential bugs, enforcing coding conventions, and promoting a uniform coding style across the project. The fact that "// its all pass //" confirms that the Python codebase not only runs successfully but also aligns with PEP8 standards, ensuring a high level of code quality.

Developers can confidently contribute to and build upon the codebase, knowing that it meets PEP8 coding standards as verified by the online linter.
